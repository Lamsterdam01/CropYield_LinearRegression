# Analysis of Climate and Environmental Factors Affecting Agricultural Productivity

This project investigates the relationship between various climate, environmental, and agricultural factors, focusing on how they influence crop yield. Using a comprehensive dataset, statistical methods, and machine learning models, this analysis aims to uncover patterns, associations, and predictive insights.

## About This Project

This work was carried out as part of a **school project** for a course on linear statistical methods and modeling. All aspects of the analysis, from data preprocessing to model development and interpretation, were written collaboratively as a team effort. The project reflects our shared commitment to applying statistical concepts to real-world problems and delivering meaningful insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Global Agriculture Climate Impact Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/talhachoudary/global-agriculture-climate-impact-dataset). It includes detailed data on:

- **Numerical Variables**: Continuous and discrete metrics such as temperature, precipitation, crop yield, and more.
- **Categorical Variables**: Regional information, crop types, and adaptation strategies.

### Key Variables
- **Target Variable**: `Crop_Yield_MT_per_HA` (Crop yield in metric tons per hectare).
- **Predictors**:
  - **Numerical Continuous**: Temperature, precipitation, CO2 emissions, soil health index, etc.
  - **Categorical**: Country, region, crop type, adaptation strategies.
